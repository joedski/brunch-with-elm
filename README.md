Brunch with Elm
===============

A simple Brunch skeleton to make writing Elm apps or testing Elm-JS things easier.



Setting Up
----------

Brunch will download the node modules, but you'll still need to run `npm run deps` afterwards to install the Elm packages.

This doesn't use any Bower packages yet.
