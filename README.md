Brunch with Elm
===============

A simple Brunch skeleton to make writing Elm apps or testing Elm-JS things easier.



Requirements
------------

Have globally installed the following:

- npm
- Brunch
- Elm (version `1.x` same as or newer than `1.5.2`.  It'll probably work.)



Setting Up
----------

Brunch will download the node modules, but you'll still need to run `npm run deps` afterwards to install the Elm packages.

This doesn't use any Bower packages yet.
